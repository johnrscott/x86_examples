# Assembly language projects for Intel architectures

This repository contains pure assembly language projects for Intel architectures, meaning no compilers, just assemblers and linkers (although I will probably admit the C standard libraries).

The projects could be used as a simple tutorial on how to program assembly language. They are fully commented and explained in each of the folders.
